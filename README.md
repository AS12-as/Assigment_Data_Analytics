# Assigment_Data_Analytics
The Assigment is about Data Analytics Using Excel and Python Where Our Main objective is to analyze datasets related to user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends. We are Working On three Different datasets csv file as  UserDetails, CookingSessions, and OrderDetails.

I have Completed The Project by solving the Problem In 2 Ways:
1. Using Python
2. Using Excel

# Using Python to Solve the problem:

# Cleaning Of the Data:
In Cleaning We just need to handle the null value of the order details file rating column by taking the mean value
# Merging Of the data:
After the Cleaning of the data We need to merge all three files using pandas merge function handling the duplicacy of the columns
# User Behavior and Order Analysis
- Analyze user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends to generate actionable business insights.
- Relationship Between Cooking Sessions, Orders, Dishes and Amount
- Identifying popular dishes
- Demographic Insights: Analyze order trends by Favourite Meal, location, age and username total orders as per differenct location 

## Findings
- Most popular dish: Spaghetti.
- Favourite People Meal is Dinner where the most orders are placed
- Highest orders from users aged 25â€“35 in New York and Los Angeles.

## Summarize findings in a report:
## Insights:
- Most popular dishes by frequency.
- Age groups or locations and favourite dishes contributing to higher orders.
- The correlation between session ratings and order amounts.
## Recommendations:
- Focus marketing on popular dishes and high-order demographics.
- Improve session experiences to boost order rates.
- Promote top dishes with targeted ads.
- Enhance session experiences to improve customer retention.

# 2. Using Excel to Solve the problem:

# Cleaning the Data:
In Cleaning We just need to handle the null value of the order details file rating column by taking the average value

# Merging the Data:
Merge the all sheet of excel to Merge sheet named Where Using lookup to #**Merge**# all the data of 3 files together

# Analyze Relationships:
Creating  a PivotTables to identify relationships and using charts For the visualization using 3 different pivot tables:
-  Pivot Named as relationship which identifies the Relationship Between Cooking Sessions, Orders, Dishes and Amount.
-  Pivot table named as Popular Dishes which identifies the total ordered dish which dish ordered the most.
-  Pivot Table Named as Demographics Insights Shows us the Relationships of Favourite Meal, Locations With respect to the total orders

# Insights and Recommendations
# Summarize findings in a new sheet document:
# Insights:
- Identify the most popular dishes orderd (based on the bar chart).				
-  List top-performing demographics (based on PivotTable analysis).			

# Recommendations				
- Focus on marketing popular dishes to high-order demographics.				
- Improve cooking sessions with low ratings to boost engagement.
